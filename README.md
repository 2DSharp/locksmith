# Locksmith

Locksmith is a smart doorbell to that notifies users when someone rings the bell at their doorstep. Connected over WebRTC via HTTPS, this allows for seamless and encrypted audiovisual communication between the house owner and visitors.

- The Locksmith app allows users to receive notification when someone is at the door.
- Audio-visual communication over WebRTC.
- Remotely control the lock system on the door with a secure pin.

For the service that runs the backend for the application check out [Locksmith-Backend](https://github.com/2DSharp/locksmith-backend).

## Getting Started

Locksmith is a Flutter project written in Dart, thus allowing us to build on iOS and Android sacrificing some performance.
However due to the nature of the app, this is a feasible tradeoff.

### Minimum Requirements
- Android Marshmallow and above
- An active internet connection

### Building the application

- **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/2DSharp/locksmith.git`
- `cd/` into the root directory and run `flutter run`.

Thanks to Flutter's Hot Reloading features, integrating and testing builds without having to manually re-compile and rebuild is easy on Android Studio.
